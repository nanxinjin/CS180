     * Requirements
     * 
     *  - Print out "Enter scores now:"
     *     (Make sure there is no space after the colon here)
     *  - Takes in scores (ints) from the user until they 
     *     enter a -1.
     *  - After the user enters -1, you will print out the
     *     lowest score, the highest score, and the average 
     *     of the scores (rounded to the floor, or greatest integer not
     *     exceeding the average. Just use integer division).
     *     See the format outlined in the instructions' sample execution.
     * 
     * Hints 
     *  - No arrays are necessary for this method. If you try to use them, you
     *    are doing too much work
     *  - You can calculate the average by maintaining the sum of all the grades
     *    and the count of all the grades and only calculating the average when
     *    the user is done supplying the grades.
     *  - Maintain one variable for each statistic (count, sum, lowest,
     *    highest), updating each of them for each grade entered.
     *  - When printing the output; note that the output statistics are right
     *    justified.
     *  - You can assume all scores range from 0 to 100 (inclusive). 
     *  - To print out, you can use the following lines
     *
     *    System.out.println("=====-----=====-----=====-----=====");
     *    System.out.println("=            Test Results         =");
     *    System.out.printf("= Average: %22d =\n",average);
     *    System.out.printf("= Lowest:  %22d =\n",lowest);
     *    System.out.printf("= Highest: %22d =\n",highest);
     *    System.out.println("=====-----=====-----=====-----=====");
     * 
     * Where 'average', 'lowest', and 'highest' are int variables whose values
     * are the values you computed.
